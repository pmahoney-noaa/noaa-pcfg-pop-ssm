Lower CI and Upper CI correspond to the lower and upper 95% credible intervals. $Rhat$ values less than 1.01 indicate effective mixing within and across chains, producing reliable and consistent estimates for the parameters. $ESS$ is the effective sample size and is an indicator of chain sampling efficiency. Here, $ESS$ values greater than 300 indicate sufficient sampling has been achieved.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-coefs .cell tbl-cap='Coefficient estimates for models with coefficients on log $\\lambda$.'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n\n\nModel                                 Variable           Mean     Median     SD      Lower CI    Upper CI    Rhat     ESS_bulk \n-----------------------------  ----------------------  --------  --------  -------  ----------  ----------  -------  ----------\nENP Calves                        $\\beta_{Calves}$      -0.004    -0.004    0.036     -0.064      0.055      1.000     1447.6  \nPCFG Calves only                  $\\beta_{Calves}$      0.021     0.020     0.020     -0.010      0.055      1.000     2918.1  \nENP Strandings only             $\\beta_{Strandings}$    -0.002    -0.002    0.001     -0.004      0.001      1.000     2198.9  \nPCFG Calves + ENP Strandings      $\\beta_{Calves}$      0.016     0.015     0.020     -0.015      0.049      1.001     2505.2  \nPCFG Calves + ENP Strandings    $\\beta_{Strandings}$    -0.001    -0.001    0.002     -0.004      0.001      1.001     1934.6  \n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Leave-one-out Cross Validation (LOO)\n\n@tbl-loo provides estimates of model fit using an information criterion (leave-one-out information criterion; *looic*) based on leave-one-out cross validation.

Predicting future states, or \"forecasting\", is notoriously challenging particularly as we project further into the future. However, within this system, data gaps of one or two years represent the most plausible scenarios managers are likely to encounter, providing the basis for our evaluation. In addition, we anticipated relative performance within model sets was likely to vary as we projected further into the future. Thus, in order to document a potential shift in model support in relation to projection length, we evaluated predictive performance when projecting one and two years separately. Finally, we evaluated predictive performance using models fitted to both truncated and complete abundance time series. The latter provides the best available knowledge of the system for model fitting, but might bias retrospective evaluations of predictive performance due to information \"spillover\" from future observed population states. The former can become data limited and select for overly simplistic models.\n\nAll time series used in model fitting started with estimates from 2002, but varied in their end point. In the case of truncated times series, we fit each of the six specified models to multiple time series with varying end points from 2013 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2014 through 2022. Notably, we evaluated endpoints between 2006 and 2012, but these shorter time series were inadequate for model convergence. In the case of the complete time series, we fit all seven models to a single time series representing abundance data from 2002 through 2022. Model parameters were then used to retrospectively project abundance forward one or two years from 2002 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2003 through 2022.\n\nIn all cases, projected estimates were then compared to \"observed\" abundance in the same year using residual sum of squares (RSS), 60% and 95% credible intervals, and whether an estimate dropped below threshold resulting in a presumed hunt closure. Predictive fits were summarized by one or two year projection lengths.\n\n### *Model fits derived from truncated time series*\n\nThe following tables show predictive performance statistics by model specification when predicting one (@tbl-tRetro1summ) or two years forward (@tbl-tRetro2summ) from all data years between 2013 and 2021.
