# *Model description*

The SSM models abundance in log-space with Gaussian errors and can be defined as the following:

*Observation process:*

$$ logN_{est} \sim normal(logN, \sigma_{obs}) $$

*State process:*

$$ logN_{est_{t+1}} = logN_{est_{t}} + ln(\lambda_{t}) $$

$$ ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(\mu, \sigma) $$

Where $logN$ and $\sigma_{obs}$ are the estimated (log) population abundance and standard error for each year with observation data, respectively. Models vary by the specification of $\lambda$ and the factors hypothesized to be correlated with population growth, at least given current knowledge and available data within this system. At present, seven models were considered. (DEFINE LAMBDA AND MU)

1.  Base: $\mu = \mu_{ln(\lambda)}; \sigma = \sigma_{ln(\lambda)}$
2.  AR1: $\mu = ln(\lambda_{t-1}); \sigma = \sigma_{ln(\lambda)}$
3.  ENP calves: $\mu = \mu_{ln(\lambda)} + \beta_{calves} * C_{t}; \sigma = \sigma_{ln(\lambda)}$
4.  (PCFG) Calves only: $\mu = \mu_{ln(\lambda)} + \beta_{calves} * C_{t}; \sigma = \sigma_{ln(\lambda)}$
5.  (ENP) Strandings only: $\mu = \mu_{ln(\lambda)} + \beta_{strand} * S_{t}; \sigma = \sigma_{ln(\lambda)}$
6.  (PCFG) Calves + (ENP) Strandings: $\mu = \mu_{ln(\lambda)} + \beta_{calves} * C_{t} + \beta_{strand} * S_{t}; \sigma = \sigma_{ln(\lambda)}$

<!--#  1. Base: $ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(\mu_{ln(\lambda)}, \sigma_{ln(\lambda)})$  2. AR1v1: $ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(ln(\lambda_{t-1}), \sigma_{ln(\lambda_{t})})$  3. AR2v2: $ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(\mu_{ln(\lambda_{t})} + ln(\lambda_{t-1}) * \beta, \sigma_{ln(\lambda_{t})})$  4. ENP calves: $ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(\mu_{ln(\lambda_{t})} + C_{t} * \beta_{calves}, \sigma_{ln(\lambda_{t})})$  5. (PCFG) Calves only: $ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(\mu_{ln(\lambda_{t})} + C_{t} * \beta_{calves}, \sigma_{ln(\lambda_{t})})$  6. (ENP) Strandings only: $ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(\mu_{ln\lambda} + S_{t} * \beta_{strand}, \sigma_{ln\lambda})$  7. (PCFG) Calves + Strandings: $ln(\lambda_{t}) \sim normal(\mu_{ln(\lambda_{t})} + C_{t} * \beta_{calves} + S_{t} * \beta_{strand}, \sigma_{ln(\lambda_{t})})$  -->

$C_{t}$ corresponds the number of calves in year *t* (either ENP or PCFG); $S_{t}$ corresponds to the number of ENP strandings in year *t*.

### Additional prior specifications

Where appropriate, the following weakly informative hyper-priors were implemented for both mean and scale parameters in the $ln(\lambda)$ priors.

$$ \mu_{ln(\lambda)} \sim normal(0, 1) $$

$$ \sigma_{ln(\lambda)} \sim lognormal(0, 1) $$

Importantly, $\sigma_{ln(\lambda_{t})}$ is constrained to be positive. For models with beta coefficients (models 4 - 6), additional normal priors are specified for each coefficient, *i* (e.g., $ln(\lambda_{t-1})$, ENP calves, PCFG calves, or number of strandings). At present, no hyper-priors were used for coefficients.

$$ \beta_i \sim normal(0, 1) $$

# *Modeling environment*

All modeling was conducted using the package `cmdstanr` [@cmdstanr] in **R** [@Rcore] . Posterior sampling was performed using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with three chains in parallel. The number of warmup (n~i~ = 1000) and sampling iterations (n~i~ = 1000) were kept at their defaults as these were adequate for sampling posterior distributions. Refer to the chain diagnostic summary [table](supp_diagnostics.html) or the [R code](https://github.com/pmahoney-noaa/noaa-pcfg-pop-ssm) for more details.
