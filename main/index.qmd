# *Intent*

The abundance of gray whales within the Pacific Coast Feeding Group (PCFG) - a subset of the broader Eastern North Pacific (ENP) population - is estimated within a Jolly-Seber modeling framework using data derived from yearly mark-resight surveys [@harrisPCFG2022]. Due to the time required to match thousands of sightings each year to a growing photographic catalog, the most recent abundance estimates often lag behind the current calendar year by one or more years. However, management decisions are contingent upon abundance estimates for PCFG gray whales through the current calendar year or into the next. To meet this need, we implemented a Bayesian state-space model (SSM) to predict abundance beyond the last year for which PCFG abundance was estimated.
