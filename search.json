    "text": "Model fitting diagnostics\nAll modeling was conducted using the R package cmdstanr (Gabry et al. 2024). Posterior sampling was performed using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with three chains in parallel. The number of warmup (n = 1000) and sampling iterations (n = 1000) were kept at their defaults as these were adequate for sampling posterior distributions. Table B1 provides a summary of chain-specific diagnostics by model specification. Chains with few to no divergences (Number Divergent) and with zero or a small fraction of sampling iterations reaching maximum tree depth (Number Max Treedepth) indicate adequate sampling of posteriors and overall good chain performance. Similarly, an estimated Bayesian fraction of missing information (eBFMI) greater than 0.3 suggests reliable inference can be drawn from posterior estimates (Betancourt 2016).\n\n\n\nTable B1: Chain diagnostics by model specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n      \n      Number Divergent\n      Number Max Treedepth\n      eBFMI\n    \n  \n  \n    \n      Base\n    \n    Chain 1\n0\n0\n0.40\n    Chain 2\n0\n0\n0.42\n    Chain 3\n0\n0\n0.47\n    \n      AR1\n    \n    Chain 1\n0\n0\n0.25\n    Chain 2\n0\n0\n0.34\n    Chain 3\n0\n0\n0.30\n    \n      ENP Calves\n    \n    Chain 1\n0\n0\n0.52\n    Chain 2\n0\n0\n0.59\n    Chain 3\n0\n0\n0.68\n    \n      PCFG Calves only\n    \n    Chain 1\n0\n0\n0.48\n    Chain 2\n0\n0\n0.41\n    Chain 3\n0\n0\n0.47\n    \n      ENP Strandings only\n    \n    Chain 1\n0\n0\n0.28\n    Chain 2\n0\n0\n0.27\n    Chain 3\n0\n0\n0.29\n    \n      PCFG Calves + ENP Strandings\n    \n    Chain 1\n0\n0\n0.33\n    Chain 2\n0\n0\n0.34\n    Chain 3\n0\n0\n0.33\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBetancourt, Michael. 2016. “Diagnosing Suboptimal Cotangent Disintegrations in Hamiltonian Monte Carlo.” https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00695.\n\n\nGabry, J., R.

Predicting future states, or “forecasting”, is notoriously challenging particularly as we project further into the future. However, within this system, data gaps of one or two years represent the most plausible scenarios managers are likely to encounter, providing the basis for our evaluation. In addition, we anticipated relative performance within model sets was likely to vary as we projected further into the future. Thus, in order to document a potential shift in model support in relation to projection length, we evaluated predictive performance when projecting one and two years separately. Finally, we evaluated predictive performance using models fitted to both truncated and complete abundance time series. The latter provides the best available knowledge of the system for model fitting, but might bias retrospective evaluations of predictive performance due to information “spillover” from future observed population states. The former can become data limited and select for overly simplistic models as time series shorten.\nAll time series used in model fitting started with estimates from 2002, but varied in their end point. In the case of truncated times series, we fit each of the six specified models to multiple time series with varying end points from 2013 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2014 through 2023. Notably, we evaluated endpoints between 2006 and 2012, but these shorter time series were inadequate for model convergence. In the case of the complete time series, we fit all six models to a single time series representing abundance data from 2002 through 2023. Model parameters were then used to retrospectively project abundance forward one or two years from 2002 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2003 through 2023.\nIn all cases, projected estimates were then compared to “observed” abundance in the same year using residual sum of squares (RSS), the quantile for observed abundance, 60% and 95% credible intervals, and whether an estimate dropped below threshold resulting in a presumed hunt closure. Predictive fits were summarized by one or two year projection lengths.\n\n\nThe following tables show predictive performance statistics by model specification when predicting one (Table 3) or two years forward (Table 4) from all data years between 2013 and 2021 using the truncated time series described above.

    "text": "Given that prediction was the primary objective of this exercise, we evaluated the ability of each model to retrospectively predict a “future”, known population abundance using the PCFG abundance time series from (Harris et al. 2025). Predicting future states, or “forecasting”, is notoriously challenging particularly as we project further into the future. However, within this system, data gaps of one or two years represent the most plausible scenarios managers are likely to encounter, providing the basis for our evaluation. In addition, we anticipated relative performance within model sets was likely to vary as we projected further into the future. Thus, in order to document a potential shift in model support in relation to projection length, we evaluated predictive performance when projecting one and two years separately. Finally, we evaluated predictive performance using models fitted to both truncated and complete abundance time series. The latter provides the best available knowledge of the system for model fitting, but might bias retrospective evaluations of predictive performance due to information “spillover” from future observed population states. The former can become data limited and select for overly simplistic models as time series shorten.\nAll time series used in model fitting started with estimates from 2002, but varied in their end point. In the case of truncated times series, we fit each of the six specified models to multiple time series with varying end points from 2013 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2014 through 2023. Notably, we evaluated endpoints between 2006 and 2012, but these shorter time series were inadequate for model convergence. In the case of the complete time series, we fit all six models to a single time series representing abundance data from 2002 through 2023. Model parameters were then used to retrospectively project abundance forward one or two years from 2002 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2003 through 2023.\nIn all cases, projected estimates were then compared to “observed” abundance in the same year using residual sum of squares (RSS), the quantile for observed abundance, 60% and 95% credible intervals, and whether an estimate dropped below threshold resulting in a presumed hunt closure. Predictive fits were summarized by one or two year projection lengths.\n\n\nThe following tables show predictive performance statistics by model specification when predicting one (Table 3) or two years forward (Table 4) from all data years between 2013 and 2021 using the truncated time series described above.

    "text": "Overview\n\nModeling results\nSix competing models were evaluated for their ability to capture historical - as well as predict future - PCFG abundance using annual survey data. Each model reflects hypothetical drivers of population growth in the PCFG and our current understanding of the system as whole (Model Description). Specifically, models vary in how population growth rates (\\(\\lambda\\)) vary from year-to-year, whether represented as an average expectation (e.g., base model) or influenced by one or more population variables (e.g., PCFG calve numbers). Models were fitted to estimates of PCFG gray whale abundance, which are based on data from photo-identification surveys between 2002 and 2023 and analyzed within a Jolly-Seber modeling framework. The most recent estimate of PCFG abundance in 2023 was 213.1 (SE = 15.5, Nmin = 200) non-calf individuals within the PCFG (Harris et al. 2025). \nOf the six models considered, the autoregressive model with a one-year lag (AR1) fit the full time series of abundance data the best (Table 2). When evaluating the ability of each model to predict a “future” population size using the historical time series as a reference (the so-called Retrospective Analysis), the AR1 model continued to perform best when naively2 projecting 1) one year forward based on models fit to truncated time series, and 2) one or two years forward when using a model fit to the complete time series.  However, there appears to be more uncertainty in AR1 estimates in year two of projections relative to the other models considered. The base model, or the model where \\(\\lambda\\) was based on an average annual \\(\\lambda\\) estimated from the long-term trend in abundance since 2002, performed best when naively projecting two years forward with truncated times series.\nEvaluating the naive predictions revealed that the model with ENP strandings substantially underestimated PCFG abundance during an unusual mortality event (UME) from 2019 to 20233 (Raverty et al. 2024) (see Figure 1 in “Model Results”). Although model predictions improved when fit to the complete time series, the covariate for ENP strandings was removed from consideration out of an abundance of caution until such time when the impact of another UME on model predictions can be evaluated. The removal of ENP strandings reduced the model set from six to four total models.\nIn addition, both the base and AR1 model could be slow to respond to rapid changes in population growth given neither model accounts for environmental factors signaling a change in population trend. However, the extent of the overshoot is dependent on the degree to which \\(\\lambda\\) shifts, but overall the AR1 model recovers the quickest (Figure C1-C4). Further, the base model, by virtue of relying on an average expectation for \\(\\lambda\\), exhibits a persistent bias in population estimates during both extended negative and positive population trends (Figure C1-C4).\nIn light of these behaviors, and the inherent uncertainty associated with model selection, a model averaging approach was used to forecast abundance estimates through 2025. However, due to the poor performance of models with ENP strandings during the 2019 UME, the model averaging was constrained to the remaining four models (Table 2). The weighted model average predictions in Table 1 above therefore represent our best supported and most accurate projections of PCFG population abundance in 2024 and 2025. Further, the model-averaged estimates for PCFG abundance (N) and minimum abundance (Nmin), including the estimates from the four models individually, were above key management thresholds for N and Nmin in 2024 and 2025 (Figure 1).\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Model weights derived using pseudo-Bayesian model averaging with bootstrapping (pseudoBMA+) for all models without ENP strandings.

    "text": "Methodology\n\nModel development\nSeveral models were developed and evaluated to forecast the population size of PCFG gray whales in future years. To do so, a model-estimated annual growth rate (i.e., \\(\\lambda\\)) was iteratively applied to future years using the most recent estimate of population size as a starting point (2023). The models developed for population forecasting varied based on assumptions made about the PCFG growth rate (e.g., assuming \\(\\lambda\\) in a given year is or is not correlated with \\(\\lambda\\) in the previous year), and factors hypothesized to be correlated with population growth (such as how many calves had been sighted or how many ENP gray whales had washed ashore dead or stranded in the previous year). Details about the parameters included in each of the six models can be found on the Model Description page.\n\n\nModel selection\nModel fit was evaluated using leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV) using the complete mark-resight time series from Harris et al. (2025). LOOCV is a method whereby models are fit to the full dataset, but the quality of the fit is evaluated by iteratively removing and predicting a single record from the data time series (in this case, an annual abundance estimate). Models were in turn ranked using the leave-one-out information criterion (LOOIC, Vehtari, Gelman, and Gabry 2017), a criterion based on LOOCV wherein smaller values equate to better fitting models (see “Leave-one-out Cross Validation”). \n\n\nModel evaluation and performance\nModel performance was evaluated by assessing the ability of each model to retrospectively predict a “future” known population abundance from the mark-resight time series (see Harris et al. 2025). Specifically, predictive accuracy of each model was evaluated by fitting to 1) a truncated time series where the model was fitted with data only up to the prediction year being evaluated to make the same predictions, and 2) the full time series, less the number of years being predicted (e.g., 2002 - 2021). Scenario (1) reflects the naivety of the current model to future population states when projecting estimates, but constrains knowledge of the system and associated dynamics by truncating the data time series, providing a pessimistic assessment of models that are more sensitive to sample size. Scenario (2) provides the most comprehensive understanding of factors influencing \\(\\lambda\\), but can impose undue influence on projections from past years, providing a slightly optimistic assessment of predictive performance. Details from these assessments can be found in sections “Model fits derived from truncated time series” and “Model fits derived from full time series”.\nSimulation analyses were also conducted to look at model behavior for the models most likely to over- or under-predict the true abundance following a trend in \\(\\lambda\\). Two hypothetical scenarios were tested; 1) a stable population of 250 individuals (\\(\\lambda\\) = 1 for 15 yrs)  that went into successive years of decline, and 2) a stable population of 125 individuals (\\(\\lambda\\) = 1 for 15 yrs) that experienced successive years of growth (see “Simulation analysis”). \n\n\nModel averaging\nIn cases where the accuracy of predictions is paramount, model averaging is recommended as a means of dealing with uncertainty in model selection and model behavior (Burnham, Anderson, and Huyvaert 2011; Anderson 2007). Model averaging is a statistical approach by which multiple models are combined in order to derive a single best estimate. The models are combined by first estimating the strength of support for each model (via metrics such as LOOIC), which in turn is used to derive model-specific weights reflecting how much influence each model will have on the final estimates. Here, model weights were derived using a pseudo-Bayesian model averaging approach with bootstrapping (Yao et al. 2018). These weights were then applied to the abundance estimates from 2002 through 2023 as well the forecasted estimates through 2025.",

    "text": "Future Updates\nThis forecast will be updated as new PCFG abundance estimates become available. With each additional year, we anticipate the model predictions will become more accurate as the time series informing it becomes longer. The exact weighting of models may vary from year to year; new data may reveal changes in model performance, and the relative weighting of models averaged to predict PCFG abundance will be updated to reflect the most recent data available.  \nModels containing coefficients dependent on external data (i.e., calf counts) may be dropped if data of suitable quality are not available for a given year. Testing and validation demonstrate the Base and AR1 models perform sufficiently to make reasonable predictions of PCFG abundance in the absence of recent calf counts.",

    "text": "Model description\nThe SSM models abundance in log-space with Gaussian errors and can be defined as the following:\nObservation process:\n\\[ lnN_{est} \\sim normal(lnN, \\sigma_{obs}) \\]\nState process:\n\\[ lnN_{est_{t+1}} = lnN_{est_{t}} + ln(\\lambda_{t}) \\]\n\\[ ln(\\lambda_{t}) \\sim normal(\\mu, \\sigma) \\]\nWhere \\(lnN\\) and \\(\\sigma_{obs}\\) are the estimated (log) population abundance and standard error for each year with observation data, respectively. Models vary by the specification of \\(\\lambda\\) - representing the rate of growth in abundance from year to year - and the factors hypothesized to be correlated with population growth, at least given current knowledge and available data within this system. At present, six models were considered.\n\nBase: assumes future PCFG whale abundance is informed by the average growth rate (\\(\\mu_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)), with an associated measure of variability or uncertainty (\\(\\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)), for all years since 2002.\n\\[ \\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\]\nAR1: assumes an autoregressive correlation in population growth (\\(\\lambda\\)). In this case, population growth in the current year (\\(\\mu\\) or \\(ln(\\lambda_{t})\\)) is dependent upon population growth in the previous year (\\(ln(\\lambda_{t-1})\\)), permitting more flexibility and short-term trends in population abundance through time.\n\\[ \\mu = ln(\\lambda_{t-1}); \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\]\nENP calves: similar to the Base model, the ENP calves model includes a covariate representing the number of Eastern North Pacific (ENP) gray whale calves, permitting the average expectation for population growth to scale (\\(\\beta_{calves}\\)) with the number of reported calves in the previous year (\\(C_{t-1}\\)). The ENP calves model is informed by a long-term dataset from counts of gray whale calves as they migrate with their mothers past Piedras Blancas, California to more northerly feeding grounds in the Bering, Beaufort, and Chukchi seas (Lang, Eguchi, and Weller 2024). Notably, the numbers of ENP calves correlates with calf numbers observed in the PCFG range, providing the benefit of a more standardized and rigorous time series than that is available for PCFG calves alone. Further, these data are more consistently available during years in which PCFG abundance estimates, or possibly PCFG calf counts, are available, providing a measure of constraint on our expectations for population growth during projected years.\n\\[ \\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{calves} * C_{t-1}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\]\nPCFG Calves only: as with the ENP calves model, the PCFG calves model includes a covariate representing the number of PCFG gray whale calves, permitting our average expectation for population growth to scale (\\(\\beta_{calves}\\)) with the number of reported calves in the previous year (\\(C_{t-1}\\)). PCFG calf counts are collected during the feeding season (June-November) surveys in the PCFG range of 41°-52°N. Observed whales can be hard to classify as calves during the feeding season because the mean observed weaning date is 1 August, after which observers cannot confidently classify the whale as a calf (Lang, Eguchi, and Weller 2017). The advantage of this data set is that it is a direct observation of just PCFG whales and is not influenced by fluctuations in productivity of ENP whales that feed in the Arctic.\n\\[ \\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{calves} * C_{t-1}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\]\nENP Strandings only: includes a covariate representing the number of gray whale strandings along the coasts of California, Oregon, and Washington, permitting our average expectation for population growth to scale (\\(\\beta_{strand}\\)) with the number of reported strandings (ENP, including PCFG) in the previous year (\\(S_{t-1}\\)) during primarily the northbound migration. During stranding events, it is very rare to be able to determine if a stranded whale is a member of the PCFG due to the body position of the whale on the beach and decomposition, precluding observations of identifiable markings. Stranding data is routinely collected and will often be available in the years in which PCFG abundance is forecasted.\n\\[ \\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{strand} * S_{t-1}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\]\nPCFG Calves + ENP Strandings: incorporates both strandings and PCFG calf production as covariates informing the estimates of population growth. Stewart et al. (2023) documented that calf production and stranding records were important variables for estimating the abundance of ENP gray whales, particularly for years when no abundance estimates were collected.\n\\[ \\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{calves} * C_{t-1} + \\beta_{strand} * S_{t-1}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\]\n\n\n\nAdditional prior specifications\nWhere appropriate, the following weakly informative hyper-priors were implemented for both mean and scale parameters in the \\(ln(\\lambda)\\) priors.\n\\[ \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} \\sim normal(0, 1) \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\sim lognormal(0, 1) \\]\nImportantly, \\(\\sigma_{ln(\\lambda_{t})}\\) is constrained to be positive. For models with beta coefficients (models 4 - 6), additional normal priors are specified for each coefficient, i (e.g., \\(ln(\\lambda_{t-1})\\), ENP calves, PCFG calves, or number of strandings). At present, no hyper-priors were used for coefficients.\n\\[ \\beta_i \\sim normal(0, 1) \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling environment\nAll modeling was conducted using the package cmdstanr (Gabry et al. 2024) in R (R Core Team 2024) . Posterior sampling was performed using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with three chains in parallel. The number of warmup (n = 1000) and sampling iterations (n = 1000) were kept at their defaults as these were adequate for sampling posterior distributions. Refer to the chain diagnostic summary table or the R code for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGabry, J., R. Češnovar, A. Johnson, and S.
