    "text": "Model fitting diagnostics\nAll modeling was conducted using the R package cmdstanr (Gabry et al. 2024). Posterior sampling was performed using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with three chains in parallel. The number of warmup (ni = 1000) and sampling iterations (ni = 1000) were kept at their defaults as these were adequate for sampling posterior distributions. Table 1 provides a summary of chain-specific diagnostics by model specification. Chains with few to no divergences (Number Divergent) and that do not hit maximum tree depth (Number Max Treedepth) indicate adequate sampling of posteriors and overall good chain performance. Similarly, an estimated Bayesian fraction of missing information (eBFMI) greater than 0.3 suggests reliable inference can be drawn from posterior estimates.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Chain diagnostics by model specification.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNumber Divergent\nNumber Max Treedepth\neBFMI\n\n\n\n\nBase\n\n\nChain 1\n0\n0\n0.51\n\n\nChain 2\n0\n0\n0.56\n\n\nChain 3\n0\n0\n0.51\n\n\nAR1\n\n\nChain 1\n0\n0\n0.31\n\n\nChain 2\n0\n0\n0.25\n\n\nChain 3\n0\n0\n0.25\n\n\nENP Calves\n\n\nChain 1\n0\n0\n0.65\n\n\nChain 2\n0\n0\n0.59\n\n\nChain 3\n0\n0\n0.68\n\n\nPCFG Calves only\n\n\nChain 1\n0\n0\n0.42\n\n\nChain 2\n0\n0\n0.44\n\n\nChain 3\n0\n0\n0.46\n\n\nENP Strandings only\n\n\nChain 1\n1\n0\n0.35\n\n\nChain 2\n0\n0\n0.35\n\n\nChain 3\n0\n0\n0.38\n\n\nPCFG Calves + ENP Strandings\n\n\nChain 1\n0\n0\n0.39\n\n\nChain 2\n0\n0\n0.34\n\n\nChain 3\n0\n0\n0.38\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGabry, J., R.

Predicting future states, or “forecasting”, is notoriously challenging particularly as we project further into the future. However, within this system, data gaps of one or two years represent the most plausible scenarios managers are likely to encounter, providing the basis for our evaluation. In addition, we anticipated relative performance within model sets was likely to vary as we projected further into the future. Thus, in order to document a potential shift in model support in relation to projection length, we evaluated predictive performance when projecting one and two years separately. Finally, we evaluated predictive performance using models fitted to both truncated and complete abundance time series. The latter provides the best available knowledge of the system for model fitting, but might bias retrospective evaluations of predictive performance due to information “spillover” from future observed population states. The former can become data limited and select for overly simplistic models.\nAll time series used in model fitting started with estimates from 2002, but varied in their end point. In the case of truncated times series, we fit each of the six specified models to multiple time series with varying end points from 2013 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2014 through 2022. Notably, we evaluated endpoints between 2006 and 2012, but these shorter time series were inadequate for model convergence. In the case of the complete time series, we fit all seven models to a single time series representing abundance data from 2002 through 2022. Model parameters were then used to retrospectively project abundance forward one or two years from 2002 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2003 through 2022.\nIn all cases, projected estimates were then compared to “observed” abundance in the same year using residual sum of squares (RSS), 60% and 95% credible intervals, and whether an estimate dropped below threshold resulting in a presumed hunt closure. Predictive fits were summarized by one or two year projection lengths.\n\n\nThe following tables show predictive performance statistics by model specification when predicting one (Table 3) or two years forward (Table 4) from all data years between 2013 and 2021.

    "text": "Given that prediction was the primary objective of this exercise, we evaluated the ability of each model to retrospectively predict a “future”, known population abundance using the PCFG abundance time series from [@harrisPCFG2022]. Predicting future states, or “forecasting”, is notoriously challenging particularly as we project further into the future. However, within this system, data gaps of one or two years represent the most plausible scenarios managers are likely to encounter, providing the basis for our evaluation. In addition, we anticipated relative performance within model sets was likely to vary as we projected further into the future. Thus, in order to document a potential shift in model support in relation to projection length, we evaluated predictive performance when projecting one and two years separately. Finally, we evaluated predictive performance using models fitted to both truncated and complete abundance time series. The latter provides the best available knowledge of the system for model fitting, but might bias retrospective evaluations of predictive performance due to information “spillover” from future observed population states. The former can become data limited and select for overly simplistic models.\nAll time series used in model fitting started with estimates from 2002, but varied in their end point. In the case of truncated times series, we fit each of the six specified models to multiple time series with varying end points from 2013 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2014 through 2022. Notably, we evaluated endpoints between 2006 and 2012, but these shorter time series were inadequate for model convergence. In the case of the complete time series, we fit all seven models to a single time series representing abundance data from 2002 through 2022. Model parameters were then used to retrospectively project abundance forward one or two years from 2002 through 2021, providing projected abundance estimates for years 2003 through 2022.\nIn all cases, projected estimates were then compared to “observed” abundance in the same year using residual sum of squares (RSS), 60% and 95% credible intervals, and whether an estimate dropped below threshold resulting in a presumed hunt closure. Predictive fits were summarized by one or two year projection lengths.\n\n\nThe following tables show predictive performance statistics by model specification when predicting one (Table 3) or two years forward (Table 4) from all data years between 2013 and 2021.

Models vary by the specification of \\(\\lambda\\) and the factors hypothesized to be correlated with population growth, at least given current knowledge and available data within this system. At present, seven models were considered. (DEFINE LAMBDA AND MU)\n\nBase: \\(\\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)\nAR1: \\(\\mu = ln(\\lambda_{t-1}); \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)\nENP calves: \\(\\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{calves} * C_{t}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)\n(PCFG) Calves only: \\(\\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{calves} * C_{t}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)\n(ENP) Strandings only: \\(\\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{strand} * S_{t}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)\n(PCFG) Calves + (ENP) Strandings: \\(\\mu = \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} + \\beta_{calves} * C_{t} + \\beta_{strand} * S_{t}; \\sigma = \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)}\\)\n\n\n\\(C_{t}\\) corresponds the number of calves in year t (either ENP or PCFG); \\(S_{t}\\) corresponds to the number of ENP strandings in year t.\n\nAdditional prior specifications\nWhere appropriate, the following weakly informative hyper-priors were implemented for both mean and scale parameters in the \\(ln(\\lambda)\\) priors.\n\\[ \\mu_{ln(\\lambda)} \\sim normal(0, 1) \\]\n\\[ \\sigma_{ln(\\lambda)} \\sim lognormal(0, 1) \\]\nImportantly, \\(\\sigma_{ln(\\lambda_{t})}\\) is constrained to be positive. For models with beta coefficients (models 4 - 6), additional normal priors are specified for each coefficient, i (e.g., \\(ln(\\lambda_{t-1})\\), ENP calves, PCFG calves, or number of strandings). At present, no hyper-priors were used for coefficients.\n\\[ \\beta_i \\sim normal(0, 1) \\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling environment\nAll modeling was conducted using the package cmdstanr (Gabry et al. 2024) in R (R Core Team 2024) . Posterior sampling was performed using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with three chains in parallel. The number of warmup (ni = 1000) and sampling iterations (ni = 1000) were kept at their defaults as these were adequate for sampling posterior distributions. Refer to the chain diagnostic summary table or the R code for more details.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nGabry, J., R. Češnovar, A. Johnson, and S.
